# arabic-mode
Typing in Arabic can be a significant challenge due to keyboard limitations. Many standard keyboards do not support Arabic characters, making it difficult or impossible to input Arabic text. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially for those who need to communicate in Arabic for work, education, or personal reasons.

## Installation
You can install the package by cloning the repository then using pip:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/droubarka/arabic-mode.git
cd arabic-mode
python3 -m pip install .
```

Or you can use the following command instead:
```shell
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/droubarka/arabic-mode.git
```

## Usage
From command-line:
```shell
~$ arabic-mode 'alslam 3lykm!' '\ana asmy m7md, ant ma asmk?'
السلام عليكم!
أنا اسمي محمد, انت ما اسمك?
```
